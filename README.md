## Collection of my homelab containers for laughs and giggles. This repo updates regularly.

**TODO:**
 - 
 - ~~Add my podman containers on this repo.~~
 - ~~Convert my command-line docker/podman create into .yaml file.~~
 - Plan to convert my docker containers into kubernetes cluster (that's A LOT).
 - (A stretch...) Convert my homelab server into NixOS use primarily container (convert samba and nfs into containers) and use this as web server (for c++ and haskell web framework test bed)
