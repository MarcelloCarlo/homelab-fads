Collection of my homelab containers for laughs and giggles. This repo updates regularly. 

TODO:
1. Add my podman containers on this repo.
2. Convert my command-line docker/podman create into .yaml file.
3. Plan to convert my docker containers into kubernetes cluster (that's A LOT).
4. (A stretch...) Convert my homelab server into NixOS use primarily container (convert samba and nfs into containers) and use this as web server (for c++ and haskell web framework test bed)
